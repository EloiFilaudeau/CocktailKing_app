![CocktailKing logo](/assets/icon.png "CocktailKing logo")  
**CocktailKing** app is an application for one of my coursework of **Mobile Applications Developpement**. During my Scottish year in *Napier University* in Edinburgh, I have done various projects. The aim of this coursework was :
>to design, implement and evaluate a prototype of a mobile application for the Android platform.

For this application I have chosen to use **React Native** instead of **Android Studio**, beacause I already known this thecnology and I want to improve my skills in mobile development.  

*The mobile application I developed aims to search cocktail recipes by cocktail name, ingredients, etc. The core features of my application are, firstly the search of cocktail and secondly the possibility to save a cocktail as favorite and to share it.*
